    <h1>Kimball Vincington Bushi</h1>
    <p>I am from Bengaluru, India. Something noteworthy about me is that I can be extrovert when I want to and when it's required; other from that, I enjoy being alone in my own space and hate crowds (which is strange coming from an Indian), but it's one of the reasons I adore Idaho. I enjoy music and don't really stick to a specific genre. I suck at sports and I tried my best not to. I love to go hiking and star gazing but I have zero knowledge on stars I just stare at them.</p>
