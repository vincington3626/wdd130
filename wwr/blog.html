                        <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
                        <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the
                            Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to
                            one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our
                            family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests
                            braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip.</p>
                        <p>Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the
                            Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>

                        <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
                        <h3>Scorpions</h3>
                        <p>There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are,
                            however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can
                            be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion
                            that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in
                            the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and
                            luckily humans are not on that list!</p>
                        <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths,
                            spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be
                            found with ice, aspirin and time.</p>
                        <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes
                            or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a
                            scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>

                        <h3>Big Horn Sheep</h3>
                        <p>For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species
                            of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most
                            weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect
                            and avoid predators.</p>
                        <p>Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short
                            with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.</p>
                        <p>If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100
                            feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
