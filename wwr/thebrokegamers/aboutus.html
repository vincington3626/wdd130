        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>The Broke Gamers is the brainchild of five lifelong friends who bonded over their love for gaming and technology. Growing up, we often found ourselves gaming on low-end 'potato PCs' due to financial constraints. These experiences inspired us to create a company dedicated to providing affordable gaming solutions to others facing similar challenges. Our journey from modest beginnings to launching this venture has fueled our commitment to making gaming accessible to all.</p>
